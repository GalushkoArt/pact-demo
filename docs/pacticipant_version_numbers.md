title: Pacticipant Version Numbers
---

When publishing a pact or a verification, the resource is associated with a particular version of the pacticipant \(application\), which is identified by a version number. Just to make it very clear - the version number that is specified in the URL of a pact or a verification is the _application version number_, not the pact version. Pact versioning is done for you behind the scenes by the Broker, and is based on the content of the pact. On a side note, do not worry about creating too much data by publishing a pact with every build - this is the expected behaviour, and a new database row for the actual pact content is only created when the pact content changes \(so avoid random data in your pacts\).

If I could go back and change the name of this version number parameter, I would call it the "application codebase ref" or "application commit" rather than "application version number", as to get the most out of the Pact Broker, it should either _be_ the git sha \(or equivalent for your repository\), _be_ a git tag name, or it should _include_ the git sha or tag name as metadata if you are using semantic versioning eg. `1.2.456+405b31ec6`. You can use semantic version numbers, but you need to make sure that you strictly follow the requirements below to ensure you have reliable data for the `can-i-deploy` tool, and the git sha is the easiest and safest way to meet those requirements.

A pacticipant version number:

* is expected to change \(almost\) every time a pact is published
* should uniquely identify or be able to be mapped back to the commit of the code base that published a pact or verification \(so that you can use tags to identify and checkout the the `prod` version of your provider if you wish to [test the "matrix"](http://rea.tech/enter-the-pact-matrix-or-how-to-decouple-the-release-cycles-of-your-microservices/).\)
* should exist only on one branch of your code \(so that you don't end up tagging the same pacticipant version as being on multiple git branches\)
* should be known at release time \(so you can pass it in to `can-i-deploy` to ensure that you are safe to release\)

Good examples:

* `cefbfb4d4e1a53b8044cf399fee21033e603e5fc`
* `a86579910`
* `1.2.456+405b31ec6`

Bad examples:

* `2.0.<buildnumber>` \(see note below\)
* `2.0.0` where all of the parts are incremented manually \(because pacts from different branches and commits of your application will overwrite each other\)
* `1` \(see above\)
* A version is JUST the build number from your CI system \(because when you move CI, your numbers will start over again, see above\)

If you _do_ use a build number in your version number \(eg. `major.minor.<buildnumber>`\) then you can ensure your version number corresponds to a known commit by creating a git tag with the version number for every build. This is good practice anyway, and it means you have a way to check out that particular version of the provider if you want to [test the "matrix"](http://rea.tech/enter-the-pact-matrix-or-how-to-decouple-the-release-cycles-of-your-microservices/).

One of the advantages of using the git sha is that you can report the pact verification status back to your repository as a commit status.

## Sorting

Versions are sorted by creation order, unless you are on a very very old version of the Pact Broker, where versions were sorted semantically. Ordering by semantic version is no longer supported or recommended.
